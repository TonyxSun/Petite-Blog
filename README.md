# The Little Note Hub (AKA. Petite Note)
![Website](https://img.shields.io/website?up_message=online&url=https%3A%2F%2Ftonyxsun.github.io%2FPetite-Note%2F) 

Hey! This site is built for my family to store communal reminders and miscellaneous notes. I was't able to find a minimal collaborative task app that was easy and fast to access by different individuals, so I made my own! Take a look and you might see a bit of what is happening in our lives :). 
Created with React & JSON Server, deployed on Github Pages. 

## Configurations and Scripts
> The [database](https://github.com/TonyxSun/petite-server) is hosted on Github and [Heroku](https://petite-note-server.herokuapp.com/). There might be downtime to the app due to limitations with Heroku. 

The main scripts concerned are `npm run start` and `npm run deploy`. 

### `npm run start`
Runs the app in the development mode. Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

### `npm run deploy`
Builds the app for production to the build folder and deploys it to the `gh-pages` branch. The Github Pages site will refresh to incorporate the new build. 

## My Takeaways

* React
    * Hooks
    * States
    * Props
    * Routing
* working with JSON-Server

### To Do
* Allow editing of notes
* User authentication
* Better visuals (there is never a "good enough" design :)
